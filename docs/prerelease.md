# Prerelease

## Getting started

Before release, please ensure the following steps are taken.

First, Send a notice to your team to let them know `next` should be locked until release. After releasing, inform them of the result and unlock the `next` branch.

Second, To identify changes since the last release, use the following commands:

**Get last release commit:**

```shell
git rev-list --max-count 1 --tags
```

**Get commits since last release:**

```shell
git log --oneline --no-merges main..next
```

**Get file names that has changed since last release:**

```shell
git diff --name-only origin/main
```

For a specific path:

```shell
git diff --name-only origin/main wallets/
```

**Check the excat changes on files since last release using VSCode:**

Ensure you've added this config to your `~/.gitconfig`

```shell
[diff]
  tool = default-difftool
[difftool "default-difftool"]
  cmd = code --wait --diff $LOCAL $REMOTE
```

Then, open files with the following command:

```shell
git difftool origin/main -y
```

For a specific path:

```shell
git difftool origin/main -y wallets/
```

Note: The `-y` flag disables the prompt in the terminal.

## Testing

Before each release, we are doing some manual tests on different environments to make sure critical flows working correctly. Ensure the widget works as expected on Chrome and Firefox.

### Environments

### Testing scenarios

First, you will need to get a list of commits since the last release and check those areas first.

Then:

- Doing a single and multistep swap
  - USDT (Polygon) -> USDC (Polygon): That would be great to check switch network by changing your network to not be on Polygon.
  - Sol (Solana)-> Atom (Cosmos)
- Check your history
- Change settings (Language, Theme)
