# Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite

This project demonstrates how to use our `widget` in a Vue-based project. The widget is integrated using the [Veaury](https://github.com/devilwjp/veaury) package. `Veaury` is a package that allows you to use React components within a `Vue` project.

## Recommended Setup

In addition to the `Veaury` package, you need to have `react` and `react-dom` as dependencies for this project to work correctly. Ensure these dependencies are included in your `package.json` file.
