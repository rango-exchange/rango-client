Coinbase Wallet integration for hub.  
[Homepage](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet) | [Docs](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/wallet-sdk/docs/welcome)

## Implementation notes/limitations

### Group

#### EVM & Solana

Coinbase Wallet supports both EVM and Solana.

### Feature

#### ⚠️ Switch Account

Switch account behavior is **unreliable**:

- On **Solana**, switching accounts causes a **full page reload**.
- When connected to **both EVM and Solana**, this reload can result in **incorrect account resolution**:
  - The wallet returns a **list of all connected accounts**, not just the active one.
  - The **current account is not guaranteed to be the first item** in the list—especially for EVM.
  - As a workaround, we currently **select the first returned account** as the active account.
  - This may lead to **incorrect account selection** after switching.

Due to this behavior, switch account functionality may not work properly in multi-namespace setups.

#### ⚠️ Auto Connect

Coinbase Wallet does **not provide a `onlyIfTrusted` option** or any silent authorization method for Solana.

- If only **Solana** is selected for connection, auto-connect **will not function**.
  - Auto-connect works **only when both Solana and EVM are connected simultaneously**, relying on EVM’s eager connection logic.
- Even in this case, the wallet may **return an incorrect account** if the user has changed accounts while disconnected from the dApp.

#### ⚠️ Cross Browser

Coinbase Wallet is **only available on chromium based browsers (eg. Chrome, Brave...).**.
