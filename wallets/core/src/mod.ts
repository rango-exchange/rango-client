/*
 * Our `embedded` hasn't been migrated to NodeNext yet so it doesn't support `exports` field.
 * There are two approach to make `NodeNext` which is used for our libs with old moduleResolution:
 *
 * 1. Use direct paths, e.g. '@rango-dev/wallets-core/dist/legacy/mod'
 * 2. Add types and function that are using in `embedded` to package entry point (this file).
 *
 * The first one is better since we don't need to deprecate or having a breaking change in future,
 * But Parcel has weird behavior on resolving ESM exports. We enabled exports for Parcel using `packageExports: true` option,
 * But it will use `exports` fields whenever it finds the field in package.json and ignore `moduleResolution` in tsconfig.
 *
 * To make it work for Parcel, we should go with second mentioned option.
