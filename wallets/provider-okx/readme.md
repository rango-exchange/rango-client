### Feature

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Disconnect
Disconnecting from one namespace results in a disconnect from all namespaces. This is the result of a workaround which is explained in the `Switch Account` section.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Switch Account
If you switch accounts while still connected to the application, the `accountChanged` event will only emit for the last connected namespace. In result of that, the account for previously connected namespaces will not get updated and requires a disconnect and reconnect to properly connect to the desired account.
Also, when you call connect on a previously connected namespace, it doesn't return the address of the new account the user switched to. To prevent the user from being stuck in such situation, we call `disconnect` on the wallet whenever user disconnects the wallet from the provider. This results in a limitation which is explained in the `Disconnect` section.
